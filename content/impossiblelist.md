You might be wondering what an impossible list is and why it is here.
In contrast with a bucket list, an impossible list is ever evolving and is expected
to grow with time: you might cross things off the list, but you are also
**always adding new items** to the list. It is, therefore, _impossible_
to finish every single item in the list, hence the name.

I'm keeping my list public to encourage myself to update it and to
get other people to start their very own lists as well.
